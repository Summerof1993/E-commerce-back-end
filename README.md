# E-commerce-back-end

## Description

E-commerce back-end is a project that sought to create the back-end structure for an E-commerce website. This RESTful API has GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes set up that can easily be linked to the front end. The models in the databse were created with one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. The application runs on NodeJS and uses MYSQL as the database and expressJS as the server and Sequelize as the ORM to query the database using Object Oriented Programming. 

## Installation

Then, you will be able to test the routes using your localhost or testing applications such as insomnia or postman.
